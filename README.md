# Sorting Algorithms User Manual
This user manual explains how to use the Python implementations of five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. These implementations are ideal for educational purposes, helping users to visualize and understand the behavior of each algorithm through direct interaction.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure that Python and Git are installed on your system:
- Python (tested with version 3.9.6): Download from ``` python.org ```
- Git: Download from ```git-scm.com```
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcoro2911/exp_manual.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd exp_manual
cd sorting_alg
```
## Usage instructions 
### Running the Algorithms
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script. To run an algorithm, use the following command in your terminal:

For Quick sort:
```bash
python quick_sort.py
```
Replace 'quick_sort.py' with the corresponding file name for other sorting algorithms that you want to use('insertion_sort.py', 'selection_sort.py', 'bubble_sort.py', 'merge_sort.py').
### Input
The sorting algorithms require an array of integers as input. Please enter the numbers in any sequence, ensuring they are separated by spaces, as demonstrated in the example below:

```bash
Enter a list of numbers separated by space: 12 342 534 25 3 4 23 99 11 900
```
### Output
The output will display the initial unsorted array followed by the sorted array. It will look like this:

```c
Initial array: [12, 342, 534, 25, 3, 4, 23, 99, 11, 900]
Sorted array: [3, 4, 11, 12, 23, 25, 99, 342, 534, 900]
```
