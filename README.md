# User Manual
This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the Python implementations of five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. These implementations are designed to help users understand the algorithms' behavior through practical experience.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Git installed on your machine. The code has been tested with Python 3.9.6. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcoro2911/exp_manual.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd exp_manual
cd sorting-algorithms
```
## Using the Sorting Implementations
### Running the Algorithms
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script. To run an algorithm, use the following command in your terminal:

For Bubble Sort:
```bash
python bubble_sort.py
```
Replace 'bubble_sort.py' with the corresponding file name for other sorting algorithms ('insertion_sort.py', 'selection_sort.py', 'quick_sort.py', 'merge_sort.py').
### Input Data
The sorting algorithms expect an input array of integers. Type as many numbers as you want in any order, with a space between them, like in the example below:

```bash
Enter a list of numbers separated by space: 5 2 9 1 5 6
```
### Output
The output will display the original unsorted array followed by the sorted array. An output example will look like this:

```c
Original array: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
Sorted array: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
